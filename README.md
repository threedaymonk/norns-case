# Norns shield case extras

## Screen support

![Screen support block](./images/support.png)

These help to keep the screen horizontal and in place. They can be attached
between the screen and shield PCBs using a small piece of double-sided tape on
each side.

## Top plate

This builds the outline and screw holes from a projection of the case file,
so you'll need to download that and save it here as `norns-case.stl`.

The case is posted by JHC in
[this thread](https://llllllll.co/t/norns-shield-case-designs/30347/224).

The dimensions of the knobs and buttons can be adjusted via the appropriate
variables.

The plate is intended to be printed upside down, so that the final upper
surface is on the print bed. On my printer, this gives a pleasing finish from
the textured bed.

The four blocks on the underside help to locate the plate and prevent the case
from flexing inwards.
